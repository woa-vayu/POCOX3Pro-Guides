### Install WOA Device Manager

- Download **WOA Device Manager** and extract the file's contents somewhere.

- Open the **Install.cmd** file and follow the on-screen instructions, then open WOA Device Manager.

### Booting into FFU mode

- Plug your phone into your computer while booted in Android and press **Manual Mode** (the rotation icon on the left) in WOA Device Manager.

> If WOA Device Manager does not detect your device, reboot to **fastboot mode** instead and try again. To do this, hold the **volume down** + **power** button until the fastboot logo appears.

- In the newly opened menu, click **Switch to Windows-mode**, then hold the **volume down** button until the QR code and wrench icons appear on the screen.

### Flashing the FFU Image

- Click on **Flash** (the wrench icon on the left) in WOA Device Manager, then select your FFU file and click **Flash FFU Image**.

- Wait until the FFU image has flashed and the green check mark appears, after which your phone should boot back into Android.

> [!Note]
> If it does not boot into Android, reboot into recovery by holding the **volume up** + **power** buttons, and do a factory reset there.
