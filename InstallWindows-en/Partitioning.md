## What you will get 🛒

You will end up with both Android™ and Windows on your POCO X3 Pro. Android™ and Windows will both split the internal storage.

Android™ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you flash UEFI in boot partition or use M3K WoA Helper.

## Going to the Bootloader menu

- Start by turning on your POCO X3 Pro into Android™, and unlock it

- Open a command prompt on your PC

- Go to the folder where you extracted the Google Android™ Platform tools using the CD command and the path of the folder

- Run the following command to ensure your phone is detected by your PC

```batch
adb devices
```

> [!TIP]
> If you see no device listed, check for updates in Windows Update, you likely have a Driver Update pending so the phone is recognized, when you're good to go, you should see the following image below this notice.
> It is possible certain computers see no update offered (like Windows ARM64 Computers or other older machines with no functional Windows Update). If this is your case, we also provide Drivers for you to download
> at the following location, you will have to install them using Device Manager on your PC. [Download USB Drivers](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/raw/main/Files/USB-Drivers.zip)

- Run the following command now

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be rebooted to Poco X3 Pro's bootloader.

## Booting to recovery

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot flash recovery
```

- Go find the recovery image file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device) and press enter

- Now you can type the following text and press enter

```batch
fastboot reboot recovery
```

You will now boot to recovery. Keep the phone plugged to your PC and continue along.

## Making the partitions

- Let's run partitioning script:

```bash
adb shell partition [Amount of storage you want Windows to have (only number)]
```

- If it asks you to run it once again, do so

## Rebooting into Android

Now, reboot into Android again:

```batch
adb reboot
```

- You should now be seeing the Android™ Out of Box Experience (OOBE). Setup your phone to confirm it works correctly.

Congratulations, you successfully partitioned your device.

## The End

And we're done, please continue with the previous guide that made you land here :)
